               when Id was zero ! Added a test. 
  
             - ALU output is no longer latched, so that it is immediatly
               available in EXECUTE state (and I no longer need to activate
               it in the DECODE stage, which was WRONG because register outputs
               were not ready). On the other end, longer critical path (maybe 
               doing so is BAD...)
  
             - CALL/RET was not working: it is because when writing-back PC+4,
               PC already had PC_next value. Now write backs that need to occur
               during WAIT state (that is, shifts) have now their own state
               (WAIT_INSTR_AND_ALU). All other write backs occur during EXECUTE
               state (then followed by WAIT_INSTR state).
  
             - verilator --lint-only detected a couple of width mismatch 
                in the RAM controller that explained load/store address mismatch  
  
             - there were several bugs in my RAM array *test program* (register clashes,
                and forgot to save ra when calling func from func).
  
             - OLed: I had forgotten to program the shifter
                     I was doing stupid things for generating the write clock
                     (it is simply the negated clock !)
 
             - addi reg,-5 was adding 5
                    opqual was wrong ! bit 30 is also used by imms, 
                    thus it was changing ops
                    (in particular for negative numbers !)
                    Found out with icarus
  
             - li sp,0xff8 generates an invalid opcode ? 
                     (maybe extended instructions ?)

             - experienced wrong opcode in the LEDs demo program,
	         by specifying linker options -m elf32lriscv_ilp32 -b elf32-littleriscv
		 it fixed the problem (but I do not know exactly what
                 it means, maybe it was using some 64-bits specific instructions or someting...)
           

  TODO / IDEAS:
        DESIGN
             - Tests RISC-V (c.f. PICORV32), dans simulateur et 'on device' si possible
             - Check all recommendations from MIT course:
                   http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/handouts/L11_4.pdf
                   - beware of clock skew, don't gate the clock
                   - always assume that combinatorial logic glitches
                   - Never drive a critical asynchronous control signal 
                     (register clock, write enable) from the output of 
                      combinational logic.  
                   - Ensure a stable combinational output before it is sampled by CLK
                   - When needed, create glitch-free signals by registering outputs.
                   - Synchronize all asynchronous signals, Use two back-to-back registers  
                         http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/handouts/L09_4.pdf
                   - Do I have ill-formed pipelines ? (slide 14)
             - Need to find a way of latching ALU output, in order to break
               critical path (maxfreq is now 37 MHz, we can probably do 50 MHz)
               Critical path is way too long, need to insert registers in IO controller
               and maybe in other places (but I'm really running out of LUTs)
             - Gain some LUTs by reducing address bus width in RAM and mapped IO 
                and latched addresses (and this will also reduce the critical path since
                the adder is plugged on it !)
             - Maybe gain some LUTs by not storing the two LSBs of the PC counter, and do
               PC+1 instead of PC+4
             - Try increasing freq to 60 MHz and decreasing OLED controller freq (slower clock, 
               affect (&) both OLED clock signal and shifter)
 
         TOOLS
             - Modular compilation and linking ? (+ automatic elimination of unused symbols)
             - Find a way of interfacing gcc (nearly there ...)
  
         FIRMWARE / DEMOS
             - Mandelbrot set demo (will it be fast ? not very fast...)
  
         MAPPED IO / PERIPHERALS
             - Interface for led matrix display
