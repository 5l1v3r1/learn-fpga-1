TODO: compliance test ! 
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-compliance/


  Bugs: on init, get_char() returns garbage the first time.

  Lessons taken:
             - simulation is important ! (of course)
	     - use generic primitives as much as possible, and let
	       yosys infer BRAMs (my handwritten code with SB_xxx
	       primitives used more LUTs than what yosys does)
	     - when there is a bug, it can be in the hard, but it
	       can be in the soft as well !
	     - femtorv32 state machine: choose good names for the states,
	       and be super clear about what's ready or not at the beginning
	       and at the end of each state
	     - reg is not a register, it is an abstraction that can be transformed
	       into a reg/latch by the synthetizer if need be.
	     - everything that appears on the left side of '=' or '<=' should be a
	       reg.
	     - number of used LUTs can vary in surprising manners ! For instance,
	       sometimes changing the *names* of variables has an influence (???)

  Observations:
             - RISCV is super-well design and smart ! At the beginning, the design
	       decision they took may seem weird (32 bit constant loaded by two
	       different instructions, one PC-relative, or 5 different encoding for
	       the constants, with parts of the bits scrambled in different parts
	       of the instr, or special register x0), but everything makes sense
	       when you write the instr decoder:
	          - source and dest registers (5 bits) always at the same position
		  - ALU op always at the same position
		  - sign-expanded bit always at the same position
	       Consequence: decoder uses a minimal number of gates, has low logic
	       depth, its outputs do not need to be latched.
	     - Coding in RISCV assembly is easier than I thought: few instructions
	       to remember, so can be learnt quickly ! And for the somewhat weird
	       instructions (lui, auipc, jal, jalr), the 'pseudo-instructions'
	       (li, la, call, ret, branch variants) make things easier. The ABI
	       register names make thing easier as well. 
             - Having an assembler, linker, c compiler ready is fantastic !
	       The only difficult part was:
	          1) finding the right switch to generate pure RV32I instructions
		  2) finding a way of generating an ELF and extracting the raw content
		  3) converting this raw content into a form that VERILOG's $readmemh()
		     can understand.

  DebugLog:
             - after reorganization of ALU (busy signal separated
	       into ALU busy + decoder needWaitAlu), I had a big
	       bug: shift by register content was no longer working !
	       It is because I forgot to set needWaitAlu in register - register shift op.
	          Debug strategy that worked:
		    1) detect bug (sieve.c was not working) -> suspected weird interaction
		       with UART (but in fact it was not the problem)
		    2) minimal example
		    3) send data to LED, made sure the problem was still there 
		       -> ruled-out UART problem
		       -> identified shift instruction as the culprit
		    4) simulation + display of word sent to the LEDs
		                  + full display of the processor's state.

             - get_char() "clicking" twice: it was <enter> generating CR,LF!
  
             - I had swapped LB,LBU and LH,LHU

             - register write back was writing stuff in some registers
               when Id was zero ! Added a test. 
  
             - ALU output is no longer latched, so that it is immediatly
               available in EXECUTE state (and I no longer need to activate
               it in the DECODE stage, which was WRONG because register outputs
               were not ready). On the other end, longer critical path (maybe 
               doing so is BAD...)
  
             - CALL/RET was not working: it is because when writing-back PC+4,
               PC already had PC_next value. Now write backs that need to occur
               during WAIT state (that is, shifts) have now their own state
               (WAIT_INSTR_AND_ALU). All other write backs occur during EXECUTE
               state (then followed by WAIT_INSTR state).
  
             - verilator --lint-only detected a couple of width mismatch 
                in the RAM controller that explained load/store address mismatch  
  
             - there were several bugs in my RAM array *test program* (register clashes,
                and forgot to save ra when calling func from func).
  
             - OLed: I had forgotten to program the shifter
                     I was doing stupid things for generating the write clock
                     (it is simply the negated clock !)
 
             - addi reg,-5 was adding 5
                    opqual was wrong ! bit 30 is also used by imms, 
                    thus it was changing ops
                    (in particular for negative numbers !)
                    Found out with icarus
  
             - li sp,0xff8 generates an invalid opcode ? 
                     (maybe extended instructions ?)

             - experienced wrong opcode in the LEDs demo program,
	         by specifying linker options -m elf32lriscv_ilp32 -b elf32-littleriscv
		 it fixed the problem (but I do not know exactly what
                 it means, maybe it was using some 64-bits specific instructions or someting...)


   DEBUGGING THE STATE MACHINE:
   
   Now I think I better understand what's going on,
    by thinking about it like that:
     Rule 1: x <= y:   x is ready right at the beginning
                       of the *next* state.
     Rule 2: whenever registers or memory are involved,
                  one needs an additional cycle right
                  after register Id or mem address changed
                  before getting the value.
   
   Important:
      Carefully chose the states and their names !
      Keep in mind what's ready (and not) at the beginning of each state,
       especially when memory is involved (as well as registers since they
       are in BRAM here).




  TODO / IDEAS:
        DESIGN
             - Tests RISC-V (c.f. PICORV32), dans simulateur et 'on device' si possible
             - Check all recommendations from MIT course:
                   http:web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/handouts/L11_4.pdf
                   - beware of clock skew, don't gate the clock
                   - always assume that combinatorial logic glitches
                   - Never drive a critical asynchronous control signal 
                     (register clock, write enable) from the output of 
                      combinational logic.  
                   - Ensure a stable combinational output before it is sampled by CLK
                   - When needed, create glitch-free signals by registering outputs.
                   - Synchronize all asynchronous signals, Use two back-to-back registers  
                         http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/handouts/L09_4.pdf
                   - Do I have ill-formed pipelines ? (slide 14)
             - Need to find a way of latching ALU output, in order to break
               critical path (maxfreq is now 37 MHz, we can probably do 50 MHz)
               Critical path is way too long, need to insert registers in IO controller
               and maybe in other places (but I'm really running out of LUTs)
	         -> improved it (now 45 - 50 MHz depending on configured peripherals),
		    and seems to work well at 60 MHz 
             DONE - Gain some LUTs by reducing address bus width in RAM and mapped IO 
                and latched addresses (and this will also reduce the critical path since
                the adder is plugged on it !)
             - Maybe gain some LUTs by not storing the two LSBs of the PC counter, and do
               PC+1 instead of PC+4
             DONE - Try increasing freq to 60 MHz and decreasing OLED controller freq (slower clock, 
               affect (&) both OLED clock signal and shifter)
 
         TOOLS
             - DONE: Modular compilation and linking (+ automatic elimination of unused symbols)
             - DONE: Find a way of interfacing gcc 
  
         FIRMWARE / DEMOS
             - Mandelbrot set demo: DONE
  
         MAPPED IO / PERIPHERALS
             - Interface for led matrix display: DONE

========================================================================

DONE: from Harvard to Von Neumann
   - one unique address bus (+ instr prefetch register management)
   NEXT:
     1) fusion ROM and RAM in single component
        (use same memory map for now, replace first page of RAM
         with ROM, mandelbrot demo fits (232 words !!)
         --> DONE
     2) fusion data bus
         --> DONE
     3) use smthg similar to Claire's interface for memory, 
            move read sign expansion into processor --> DONE 
            keep write mask in memory (but adapted) --> DONE
     4) cleaner scripts to generate initial RAM content & no longer
        distingish ROM/RAM --> DONE
     5) simulation backend --> DONE
     6) resize address bus to save LUTs --> DONE
     7) investigate error flag behavior
          --> test with simpler ALU (temporarily deactivate
              shifts...) / latch for ALUbusy... --> DONE
	  --> DONE (little delay at startup, like in PicoSOC for icebreaker)    
     8) investigate critical path that seems to connect things that
        should not be connected.
